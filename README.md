# Tracker
*The aim of this app is to track time needed to perform different tasks given in a CSV file.*

**How it works:**

1. Tracker reads a csv file

2. Tracker generates a raport about time needed to perform different tasks. Raport includes different clients and other given tags.

**How to use Tracker:**

-> use the CSV file's path in the CL 

**What to keep in mind when using Tracker:**

-> data in CSV file have three columns - desc, time and tags. 
   
   1. **Desc** - the description of the task
   
   2. **Time** - time needed to perform the task in munutes
   
   3. **Tags** - list of tages separeted with spaces
   
-> one task can have more than one tag
   
->  one tag can be added to many tasks
   
-> tags are used to mark tasks as connected with projects, clients or other criteria
